                        The task is to create a website for home decor.

                        In this delivery, color selection and analysis of colors and
                        textures have a particular focus.

                <h1 class="heading-title">Some words about good design</h1>
                <p>
                    Design is not an exact science, in the sense that you cannot always say that something is bad or
                    good. But sometimes you
                    can do it more than other times. </p>
                <p>
                    The human eye searches for harmony and symmetry. Balance can be another word for symmetry. </p>
                <p>
                    Colors on a website are about psychology. Psychology is not an exact science either, but we have to
                    deal with it
                    nonetheless, because emotions are awakened by colors, and we often wish that the person looking at
                    the website should
                    feel what we want them to feel. In this sense, you can say that color selection is about
                    manipulation. </p>
                <p>
                    One often distinguishes between "warm" and "cold" colors. </p>
                <p>
                    Brown is a natural color, which is associated with relaxation, endurance, reliability, confidence,
                    warmth, comfort,
                    safety, and it is considered to be conventional and sometimes sophisticated.
                    These are key words that I feel fit in well for a website that will be about interiors. </p>
                <p>
                    I present three examples of interiors. These are framed in a greyscale frame. This has been done
                    deliberately because
                    gray tends to be a neutral color, preferably a bit conservative, but also because the message is
                    serious.
                    <br>
                <p>
                    I have used white color as background for the decor examples. White symbolizes simplicity and
                    purity. Simplicity I feel
                    harmonizes well with the principle "keep it simple". The links in the menu alternate between white
                    and black, depending
                    on whether the status is "hover" or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic color in the logo is brown, surrounded by a lighter part with the light brown text "Home
                    decoration", and it
                    harmonizes well with the fact that brown and shades of brown have been chosen for the entire
                    website. The H1 headings
                    are also in light brown, on a light background. </p>
                <p>
                    As a principle, a color on a web page should be used on more than one element. This principle has
                    been applied to this
                    website. It gives an impression of visual consistency and predictability. Safety in a way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have used "shades and tints of brown". It can be difficult to make a strict distinction between
                    brown and
                    orange. But both
                    colors have a lot in common. They are both two warm colors. They symbolize kindness and optimism.
                    I have used both "shades" and "tints" of brown. Mostly "shades" in the menu and footer. And mostly
                    "tints" in the decor
                    examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use an analogous color scheme. Colors that stand next to each other in the color wheel. The
                    purpose is to create
                    mutual harmony between the various sections on the website. I feel that a monochromatic color scheme
                    would create too
                    little contrast. It becomes a bit too minimalistic in this context. I use an analogous color scheme
                    to create the same
                    undertone for the entire website. If I were to use complementary colors, I feel the tension would be
                    stronger. A home
                    should be a place where there is harmony, not both heat and cold. By using split complementary
                    colours, the tension
                    would be reduced, but I feel that this tension is also unnecessarily large in this context. A
                    triadic color scheme could
                    perhaps have been an alternative, but again consideration for calm, warmth and harmony in the home
                    wins. </p>
                <p>
                    I have not used textures on the page. Or possibly you could call the grid in the logo textures. Nor
                    have I felt the need
                    to highlight any section of the website over others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the lesson, it is said that "shapes" can bring "interesting effects" to a website. But nothing is
                    said about what is
                    interesting and how the effect may be perceived by people. There can be very individual perceptions
                    of what an effect of
                    something is like. In any case, I feel that it will be excessively experimental to try this. </p>

                <p>
                    It is a general principle in web development to keep things simple.
                    This should also apply to color choices. In a way, it is made easy for the user if he only needs to
                    deal with a limited
                    number of colours.

                    I have made some changes and customization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got inspiration for the color choice here:

                    It seems that brown is a popular color when it comes to interiors, see

                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class="quotation"> Â«Brown was a memorable part of both 2000s and 1970s decor, and now
                    similar
                    influences are helping bring the color back. Like the 2000s, the shift toward warmer colors comes,
                    in part, because weâre responding to the prolonged uncertainty of the pandemic by incorporating more
                    comforting colors into our homesâ.

                <p>This may indicate that brown as a basic color is about to have a renaissance in interior design.

                    Jessica Bennett writes, among other things, that natural earth colors are on the rise as a trend:
                </p>
                <p class="quotation">â5. Rich Earth Tones
                    Vroom foresees kitchen color trends transitioning from softer whites and blues and toward warm,
                    grounded hues like
                    terra-cotta, blush, and even plum. "The beachy or farmhouse color palettes are taking a step back,
                    and those rich earthy
                    tones are stepping up," she says. You can also expect to see more natural wood cabinetry in kitchens
                    as homeowners
                    embrace the texture and color inherent in the woodâ.

                <p>
                    ...and, to be honest, I haven't found any element where texture would have any positive effect.
                    Possibly a negative
                    effect. As a distraction. As an opponent of the "keep it simple" principle. I am open minded to
                    suggestions that indicate I am wrong.<br />

                    âYou can get a tremendous amount of versatility from just one font (see Chapter 7), but sometimes
                    using more than one
                    font at a time can improve communication, and make your design appear more dynamic. Finding
                    typefaces that go together
                    well can be challenging. There are some rules of thumb for pairing faces, but there are exceptions.
                    Truly understanding
                    what makes types pair together can ensure that you make wise choices when you add fonts to your

                    âAlthough there are plenty of confusing and conflicting ârulesâ about typography, the common advise
                    to use no more than
                    two fonts â one of them serif, and one sans-serif â is pretty sound. You can easily create a
                    beautiful and clear
                    hierarchy using only one font family, but adding another family into the mix can provide dynamism
                    and sophistication
                    that may be hard to achieve with just one font. However, there isnÂ´t much point in using two
                    different serif fonts or
                    two different sans-serif fonts. Mixing two serif or two sans-serif types can be confusing to the
                    viewer; plus, it
                    doesnÂ´t provide enough visual variety to justify the added complexityâ.

                    So, if two fonts are
                    being used, a sans-serif face is typically used for titles and headers, while a serif face is used
                    for body copy.

                    The lower-resolution of the web leads to different habits, however (see Chapter 3 for more on why).
                    Sans-serif typefaces
                    are regarded as more readable on-screen, so when a second font is used, itÂ´s often av serif typeface

                    good place to start,

                <p>
                    The book "Design for Hackers" (page 74) gives a guideline for how large font size you can use:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Font size can be specified in px, em and rem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    px: Default = 16px for all browsers. px indicates absolute size, not relative to the parent element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    em: Default = 16px. "m" refers to the height of the font. em is a relative size, relative to its
                    nearest parent element.
                    1 em = same size as closest parent element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    rem: Default = 16px. rem is also relative, but relative to the root html element. rem was
                    introduced in 2011. 1 rem = 1 em.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The line-height should always be larger than the font-size. Use a percentage for the line-height, so
                    that it is relative to the font-size. For example 150%. The value can also be
                    1.5 without a unit, which means the same as 150%. Advice: Use relative units to make it more
                    flexible with varying font sizes.

                <h2>Classification of fonts</h2>
                <p>
                    One way to classify is to divide the fonts into two main groups: Web-Safe Fonts and Web Fonts,
                    see:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Web-Safe Fonts requires that the font is pre-installed on those who will view the website. It is a
                    hopeless assumption,
                    which makes this choice irrelevant in my opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Fonts are not pre-installed on the computer. There are two types: Internal Font Sources and
                    External Font Sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internal Font Sources must be declared in the css file with @font-face.

                    With External Font Sources you link to third-party css files instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of External Font Sources are Google Fonts and Typekit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typekit costs money, and is
                    therefore not relevant for
                    me to use in this context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Google Fonts is a remaining very relevant candidate for my delivery.

                    Another way to classify is to divide the fonts into tree main groups
                    based on the letter structure: Humanist, Geometric and
                    Realist. The theory is that
                    fonts that belong to the same letter structure go well together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why a group is called "Humanist" is that they originate from the humanist movement in the
                    time of the
                    Renaissance. Calligraphy is the art of writing, or the art of writing letters in an artistic way,
                    see:
                    <a href="https://snl.no/kalligrafi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://snl.no/kalligrafi</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geometric typefaces are influenced by circles, squares and triangles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Realist font style was created by Martin Wenzel in 2015. Martin Wenzelâs goal was to develop a
                    typeface that
                    combines grotesque and humanist styles. The result is a straightforward font, which is based on a
                    precise design,

                <p>
                    With so many fonts to choose from, it can quickly become demanding.

                    I think it's a bit naive to think that a large selection makes it easy to find something that fits.
                    If it is not what
                    Ina Saltz thinks, then one can ask if it is good advice. For my part, I would rather limit myself a
                    bit.

                    You can often go along just fine by using just one typeface family. It ensures conformity and
                    consistency.
                    And if there are
                    large variations within this family of fonts, it will be able to provide sufficient contrast.

                    on your mom, your

                    But in this context, it is ultimately me who will decide the design choice. This is a way of holding
                    myself accountable.

                <h2>My choice of fonts</h2>
                <p>
                    I choose to take into account all 7 guidelines above, except No. 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I choose fonts based on the letter structure. I choose the letter structure called Humanistic.
                    Because I think it gives a kind of artistic design, which goes well with the theme of interior
                    design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to use fonts available as Google Fonts. For the reasons referenced above.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As h1 I choose Garamond, and as h2 I choose Gill Sans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much good has been said about Garamond above, and both fonts belong to the Humanistic letter
                    structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also think they fit well together when tested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have changed the color of h1. Based on feedback after delivery Design 2, ma1. The teacher
                    suggested a bolder font. I
                    have chosen that, but I have also chosen a more reddish colour, to create a better contrast with the
                    background color. </p>
                <p>
                    h2 gets exactly the same color as h1, to support that these belong together in a hierarchy.
